# 📊 K-means Clustering using Python

This repository contains a complete implementation of the **K-means Clustering algorithm**, one of the most popular unsupervised machine learning techniques for grouping data into clusters.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

K-means clustering aims to partition `n` observations into `k` clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. This notebook covers:

- Understanding the dataset
- Preprocessing data
- Applying the K-means algorithm
- Using the Elbow method to choose optimal `k`
- Visualizing clusters

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `K-means Clustering.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the entire implementation, including visualizations and evaluation.
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
- (Optional) `dataset.csv`: Dataset used for clustering (if applicable).

---

## 📌 Key Features

- Implemented K-means from scratch using `sklearn`
- Elbow method for selecting optimal clusters
- Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Easy to understand and beginner-friendly

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`

Install required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## 🔍 Results

- Identified natural clusters in the dataset
- Determined the best number of clusters using the Elbow method
- Visualized the final cluster distribution

---

## 📊 Example Output

- Scatter plot showing clusters with centroids
- Line plot for Elbow method
